Darry died when Daenerys was five years old, and she and Viserys spent the following years wandering the Free Cities. By the beginning of \\'\\'A Game of Thrones\\'\\', Daenerys and her brother have been a guest of Illyrio Mopatis\\' in Pentos for half a year. \\'\\'Game of Thrones\\'\\' creators D. B.

Similarly, Astapori Valyrian has lost the case system of High Valyrian, so the word order is more reliably subject–verb–object (SVO) and the four genders of High Valyrian have been reduced to two, with three definite articles: \\'\\'ji\\'\\'  (animate singular, derived from High Valyrian \\'\\'ziry\\'\\'  \"him/her (accusative)\"), \\'\\'vi\\'\\'  (inanimate singular, derived from High Valyrian \\'\\'ūī\\'\\'  \"it (accusative)\"), and \\'\\'po\\'\\'  (plural, derived from High Valyrian \\'\\'pōnte\\'\\'  \"them (accusative)\").

He is a childhood friend of Catelyn Stark, having grown up with her and her two siblings at Riverrun. He subsequently appeared in Martin's books ''A Clash of Kings'' (1998), ''A Storm of Swords'' (2000), and ''A Feast for Crows'' (2005). He is set to appear in the forthcoming novel ''The Winds of Winter''. Littlefinger's primary character attributes are his cunning and boundless ambition. Originally hailing from a minor family with little wealth or influence, Baelish used manipulation, bribery, and the connections he secured at Riverrun to gain power and prestige in King's Landing. Since then, his various intrigues have directly caused several major events that have impacted Westeros, including the framing of Tyrion Lannister for the attempt on Bran Stark's life, the downfall of Lord Eddard Stark, the deaths of Lord Jon Arryn and King Joffrey Baratheon, and the War of the Five Kings.\\n\\n\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 0, '_split_overlap': [{'doc_id': '9e2951b89eb7599b597e546d1973968e', 'range': (929, 1237)}]}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': '186f29e83a7d51855aa4cfded4f33355'}>,\n",

Elastic had previously created the title sequences for ''Rome'', ''Big Love'', and ''Carnivale'' for HBO, and they were approached by Carolyn Strauss of HBO, with whom they had worked on these shows, to create the title sequence for ''Game of Thrones''.  Angus Wall, the head of title design firm Elastic, met with Strauss, the showrunners David Benioff and Dan Weiss, and producer Greg Spence to discuss the project around a year before the show debut.\\n\\nWhen the pilot was first made, it was felt that the geography of the imaginary world of Westeros and Essos might confuse the viewers, and that maps could be useful as navigational guides for the viewers. \", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 5, '_split_overlap': [{'doc_id': '1c1f3c313403065a4abc0624b500736e', 'range': (0, 143)}, {'doc_id': '8d3373db4fc3bafe33bb250df2ff851b', 'range': (831, 1034)}]}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': 'e29772576e56fb6290b2d36c33690f81'}>,\n",

An early suggestion was to use animated maps as a transition between scenes to orient viewers, but that idea was dropped as it would interrupt the narrative flow. The idea of the map was therefore moved into the title sequence.  For the original pilot, the showrunners Benioff and Weiss initially wrote the title sequence as a crow\\'s flight from King\\'s Landing to Winterfell;  however, the production team at Elastic thought the idea was too flat and devised the idea of using 3-D models within a sphere that represents the world of the show. The sphere was used to obviate the question of what might lie beyond the horizon of the map, and the whole sphere is lit by the sun in the middle.

And the organ as well.\"In another interview, Djawadi talked about the process, saying, \"That was the big guidance for me, in how I wanted to build this piece, It\\'s a different instrument, and I put it in an upper register, but the idea is that it\\'s building something that stays the same but changes over time.

Sandor serves as King Joffrey Baratheon's personal bodyguard. He subsequently appeared in Martin's ''A Clash of Kings'' (1998), ''A Storm of Swords'' (2000), and ''A Feast for Crows'' (2005). Like his brother, Sandor is regarded as one of the fiercest and strongest fighters in the Seven Kingdoms. His face is marked by gruesome facial burns he received when his brother shoved his face into a brazier as children; ever since he has retained a crippling fear of fire. While initially appearing brutal and fatalistic, he later proves to be more sympathetic and compassionate, particularly through his relationships with Sansa and Arya Stark.\\n\\nSandor is portrayed by Scottish actor Rory McCann in the HBO television adaptation.\\n\\n== Character description ==\\nSandor Clegane, known as The Hound, was the younger brother of Gregor Clegane, and was a retainer to House Lannister. \", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 0, '_split_overlap': [{'doc_id': '7daa3a1123d0c01f71353319c9e4330', 'range': (1108, 1253)}]}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': '3bfe802b60db7c49f07786e26a463ad8'}>,\n",

Also, in a multiplayer game, he can either use all his challenges on one opponent or divide them among his adversaries. He doesn't have to use all of them. Challenges can be initiated in any order, and require a player to ''kneel'' one or more characters with an icon matching the challenge type to begin the challenge. Then, the player being attacked may kneel one or more characters to attempt to oppose the challenge.

Going into filming, one of McLachlan\\'s most desired effects was the amount of smoke on the battlefield, saying \"we wanted to block the sun out so the shots would have some consistency. And I knew the fire and smoke would be incredibly beautiful.\"White smoke was used towards the beginning of filming, but as the battle went on, McLachlan decided to switch to black smoke, which was accomplished through burning diesel oil. This caused the crew to be required to wear masks and goggles, and raised concern for HBO\\'s safety officer, who eventually prohibited further use of the black smoke due to health and safety concerns.

A Song of Ice and Fire takes place on the fictional continents Westeros and Essos. The point of view of each chapter in the story is a limited perspective of a range of characters growing from nine, in the first novel, to thirty-one by the fifth. The works and their setting have inspired a large media franchise. Among the many derived works are several prequel novellas, a TV series, a comic book adaptation, and several card, board, and video games.\\n\\n== What ''type'' of thing is ''A Song of Ice and Fire''? ==\\n\\n''A Song of Ice and Fire'' is an example of all of the following:\\n\\n* Fiction – form of narrative which deals, in part or in whole, with events that are not factual, but rather, imaginary and invented by its author(s). \", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 0, '_split_overlap': [{'doc_id': 'c36979d8ee521443dd716d4280fe0273', 'range': (781, 1002)}]}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': 'efbf143540a2195d416ce45259216e29'}>,\n",

If fire removes protective vegetation, heavy rainfall may lead to an increase in soil erosion by water. Also, when vegetation is burned, the nitrogen it contains is released into the atmosphere, unlike elements such as potassium and phosphorus which remain in the ash and are quickly recycled into the soil. This loss of nitrogen caused by a fire produces a long-term reduction in the fertility of the soil, which only slowly recovers as nitrogen is \"fixed\" from the atmosphere by lightning and by leguminous plants such as clover.\\n\\nFire has been used by humans in rituals, in agriculture for clearing land, for cooking, generating heat and light, for signaling, propulsion purposes, smelting, forging, incineration of waste, cremation, and as a weapon or mode of destruction.\\n\\n', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 2, '_split_overlap': [{'doc_id': '83ebe99b0f112e76eabd9f52c8f85f4c', 'range': (0, 217)}, {'doc_id': '7fc52dfa8407c0beeaae65e4449c723', 'range': (647, 891)}]}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': 'f4f40f1cc3c90c7fdb09ed5429efa4ca'}>,\n",
